## Notion Github Embed

This is a simple project that lets you embed a GitHub user's contribution chart in a Notion document.

### How to use this?

1. Create a new Embed block in your Notion doc.
2. Set the Embed URL to `https://jandee.vercel.app/chart/%USERNAME%` replacing %USERNAME% with your GitHub username.
3. Adjust the size of the embed accordingly.
4. Bask in its glory!

#### Known caveats

1. Not responsive (looks kinda bad on mobile)
2. Notion doesn't expose the user loading the embed's color scheme so cannot dynamically create a dark scheme version of the chart.
